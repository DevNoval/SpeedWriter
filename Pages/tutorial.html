            <h2>Touch Typing</h2>
            <p>Touch typing is a practice of typing with 8 - 9 fingers without looking at the keyboard, relying on muscle memory. When touch typing, your fingers must be place on a horizontal row called the Home row keys.</p>
            <br>

            <br>
            <p>This is where your fingers rest when you're typing. Place your 4 left fingers on ASDF and your 4 right fingers on JKL;. There should be a raised notch on the "F" and "J" keys under your left and right index fingers.</p>

            <h2>Tips for improving Typing Speed</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Try typing without looking on your keyboard. This will help you memories all the keys you need to click.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Focus on accuracy, go slow and try to build your muscle memory.</li>
                <br>
                <li>When you make mistake or typo, press "ctrl" + "backspace", this will delete the entire word except for whitespace and punctuation.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Q&A</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>What is WPM?</li>
                <p>Stands for "Words Per Minute", it count how many words you type in 1 minutes</p>
                <br>
                <li>Why I can't move to the next word?</li>
                <p>When making typo, by design you have to fix your word so you can continue typing. Although I will try to improvise it so you can type seamlessly even if you're making mistake.</p>
                <br>
                <li>I can't comeback to the previous word</li>
                <p>When you finish typing without a mistake, you will continue to the next word. This will prevent users accidentally deleting the previous word.</p>
                <br>
                <li>The typing input doesn't work in mobile devices</li>
                <p>The logic doesn't work on virtual keyboard, I'm planning to remake the input logic, so you can try the website in mobile device.</p>
